# weatherapp

## Info
This is a mobile weather app that displays the current weather anywhere in the world using OpenWeather's API.
The app's homepage displays either a day background image or a night one, according to the time of the day.
To each weather event corresponds an animation.
The animated events are : clouds, rain, snow, fog and thunderstorm.
<br/> <br/>
Technologies: **VUE CLI**, **Animejs**  <br/><br/>

Have a look for yourself <a href="https://elmurie-weather-app.netlify.app/">at this link </a>!<br/><br/>

If you want to have a look at all the animations you will need to know where a certain weather event is happening, so I imagine that a weather map would come in handy : <a href="https://www.ventusky.com/"> ventusky.com</a>
